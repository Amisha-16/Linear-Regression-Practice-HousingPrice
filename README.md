# Linear Regression Practice on California Housing Dataset

## Project Overview
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset from scikit-learn. The objective is to understand regression modeling, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the California Housing dataset available in sklearn.datasets.

It contains information such as:
- Median income
- House age
- Average number of rooms
- Population
- Latitude and longitude
- Median house value (target variable)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
1. Importing required libraries
2. Loading the dataset
3. Data exploration and preprocessing
4. Splitting dataset into training and testing sets
5. Training the Linear Regression model
6. Model evaluation using metrics such as:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R² Score

## Model
The model used:
- Linear Regression (from sklearn.linear_model)

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Amisha-16/Linear-Regression-Practice.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd linear-regression-housing

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook

5. Run all cells in the notebook.

## Results
The model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics. Results may vary slightly depending on train-test split.
